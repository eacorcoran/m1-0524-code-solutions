## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What CSS properties make up the box model?

The CSS box model module defines the height, width, margin, and padding properties, which along with border properties make up the CSS box model.

- Which CSS property pushes boxes away from each other?

The margin is the space outside the border, separating the element from adjacent elements. Unlike padding, margin does not add to the physical size of the box itself but affects where it sits in relation to other elements.

Padding represents the space between the content's boundaries and the surrounding border. It's used to give breathing room around the content inside the element.
