## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?

A breakpoint in a responsive design is the “point” at which a website's content and design will adapt in a certain way to provide the best possible user experience.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?

Using percentages allows for a more fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions. For example, setting the width of an element to 50% instructs the browser to calculate half of the parent element's width automatically, regardless of the device or screen size.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?

CSS order of precedence [i.e. the smaller min-width is after the larger one and all other things are equal]
