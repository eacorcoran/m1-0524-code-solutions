## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are arrays used for?

Here are a few reasons of why arrays are so important:

- Organizing Data: Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. This can be useful when you want to group related data together.
- Ordering: Arrays are ordered, meaning that the items in an array have a specific order. This can be useful when the order of your data matters.
- Built-in Methods: JavaScript arrays come with many built-in methods that make it easy to manipulate and interact with the data. For example, you can use methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, slice, map, filter, reduce, and many others.
- Iteration: Arrays can be easily iterated over, allowing you to perform operations on each item in the array. You can use loops or array methods like forEach, map, filter, etc.
- Flexibility: Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic and can hold items of any type. An array can contain a mix of strings, numbers, objects, other arrays, etc. Also, arrays can grow or shrink in size dynamically as needed.

- Describe array literal notation.

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?

Arrays are an ordered collection that can hold any data type. An object contains a list of properties. A property is a key-value pair where the key must be a string, and the value can be of any type.

- What number represents the first index of an array?

0

- What is the `length` property of an array?

Arrays have a property on them named length which stores the number of items currently in the array. This can be used to find the total amount of elements in an array, or to access the last index of the array.

- How do you calculate the last index of an array?

You need to subtract 1 from the `length`.
