- What is the purpose of an HTML `form` element?

The <form> element defines the form and acts as a container for different types of input elements. The action attribute specifies the URL to which the form's data is sent when submitted. The method attribute defines the HTTP method to use when sending form data.

- Give five examples of form control elements.

<form>, <fieldset>, <legend>, <textarea>, <label>, <button>, and <input>

- Give three examples of `type` attribute values for HTML `<input>` elements.
