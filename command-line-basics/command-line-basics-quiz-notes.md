## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a CLI?

A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program by inputting lines of text called command-lines.

- What is a GUI?

A graphical user interface, or GUI , is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation. In many applications, GUIs are used instead of text-based UIs, which are based on typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.

  - `man`: To look up a command in the manual to get more information.

  - `mv`: To rename a directory.
