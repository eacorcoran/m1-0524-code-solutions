## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the six primary HTML elements for creating tables?

To start, a basic table requires the <table> element, which acts as the container for the table's content. Inside, data is organized using the <tr> (table row), <td> (table data), and <th> (table header) elements. Other table features include the use of <thead>, <tfoot>, and <tbody> elements to further structure the table.

- What purpose do the `thead` and `tbody` elements serve?

<thead>: Contains header rows (<tr>) that define column titles. It's important for associating data cells with their corresponding headers.
<tbody>: Wraps all the content rows (<tr>) of your table, excluding the header and footer rows. It can be used multiple times to group rows logically.

- Give two examples of data that would lend itself well to being displayed in a table.

Structure data about a person or item. Specifically, a table of inventory available for an event including specific metadata about the inventory (i.e. seat/ro. w/section, if it is old, etc). Information about a customer, such as customer since, number of orders, etc.
