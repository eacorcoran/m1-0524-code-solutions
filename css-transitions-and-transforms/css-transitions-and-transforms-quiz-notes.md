## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- The `transition` property is shorthand for which four CSS properties?

The transition property in CSS is a shorthand property that allows you to add an effect between the changes of specific CSS properties. The effect smoothly transitions from one property value to another over a given duration. This can make changes appear more natural to the eye, enhancing the user experience.

- What does the `transform` property do?

The transform property in CSS allows you to modify the visual appearance of how an element appears on a webpage. Using it, you can rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. This means you can modify the appearance and position of an element without disrupting the normal flow of the document.

- Give four examples of CSS transform functions.

rotate(): Rotates an element clockwise from its original position, with a given degree.

scale(): Increases or decreases the size of an element.

skew(): Skews an element along the X and Y axis.

translate(): Moves an element from its current position (left or right, up or down).
