## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?

Variables act as containers for storing data values.

- How do you **declare** a variable?

You declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?

The `=` symbol is used as the assignment operator in TypeScript. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?

Characters can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?

Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that capitalization matters. Two variables with the same name, but with different capitalization, are treated as 2 separate variables.

- What is the purpose of a string?

In TypeScript, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are enclosed in quotation marks; you can use single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) to define a string.

- What is the purpose of a number?

Numbers in TypeScript are used to represent both integer and floating-point values. TypeScript has a single number type, and numbers can be written with or without decimals.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?

Booleans in TypeScript represent one of two values: true or false. They are typically used in conditional testing where you need to decide which path of code to execute based on the truthiness of a condition.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?

The assignment ( = ) operator is used to assign a value to a variable or property.

- How do you update the value of a variable?

The assignment ( = ) operator is used to assign a value to a variable or property.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

The type of undefined is undefined, while null is an object.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?

Sometimes, it's helpful to put more than one console.log() in your code to help you debug, but if you do not include "labels", it can be very confusing instead of helpful. A console log "label" is simply a short string that describes the variable or value being logged.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.

`const stringVal: string = 'hello';`
// declaring a string value variable

`const numVal: number = 15;`
// declaring a number value variable

`const boolVal: boolean = true;`
// declaring a boolean value variable

`const nullVal: null = null;`
// declaring a null value variable

`let undefVal: undefined;`
// declaring a variable without assigning a value to it

`const bigNumVal: bigint = 789525455623654442231588465311546874561;`
// declaring a big int variable
