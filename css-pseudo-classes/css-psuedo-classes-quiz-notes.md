## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a pseudo-class?

A pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that defines a special state of an element. It can be used to manipulate an element in ways that are not possible with simple selectors or by accessing the document source.

- What are CSS pseudo-classes useful for?

The :hover pseudo-class applies when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is commonly used for links, buttons, and other interactive elements to indicate an element can be interacted with.

The :active pseudo-class applies when an element is being activated by the user. For example, clicking on a button and holding the mouse button down.

The :focus pseudo-class applies when an element has received focus, either from the user selecting it with the use of a keyboard or by activating it with the mouse (e.g., a form input).

The :nth-child() pseudo-class targets elements based on their position in a group of siblings. It is useful for styling specific items within a container, like alternating row colors in a table or selecting specific items in a list.
