## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Name two types of units that can be used to adjust `font-size` in CSS.

The font-size property sets the size of the font. This can be defined using various units, such as pixels (px), ems (em), or relative sizes (small, medium, large). em is relative to the font size of its parent, while px is a fixed size.

- What CSS property controls the font used for the text inside an element?

The font-family property specifies the font for an element's text. Fonts can be specified by name, like "Helvetica" or "Arial", or by a generic family, such as serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and fantasy. The browser will use the first available font from the list you provide.

- Name three different types of values you can use to specify colors in CSS.

The color property specifies the color of the text inside an element. You can use various formats to define colors, including name (red, blue), HEX (#ff0000), RGB (rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)), HSL (hsl(0, 100%, 50%)), and HSLA (hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.3)).
