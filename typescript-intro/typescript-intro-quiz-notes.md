## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- When was TypeScript introduced?

TypeScript was introduced in October 2012.

- Who created TypeScript?

TypeScript was created by Microsoft.

- What does the TypeScript `Compiler` do?

A compiler is a computer program that converts code from languages like Java and C++ into code the computer can run. During this process it checks the structure of the code, which can be very helpful with debugging.

Specifically, a TypeScript Compiler is responsible for taking TypeScript code and compiling it into valid JavaScript so that the browser can read it.

- How can you compile TypeScript to JavaScript?

You can compile TypeScript to Javascript using a `tsc` compiler. The "TypeScript Compiler", or `tsc`, is responsible for taking our TypeScript code and compiling it into valid JavaScript so that the browser can read it.

- What are some benefits of using TypeScript?

The benefits of using TypeScript:

- TypeScript's main advantages are the tools it provides for writing more robust and easier-to-read JavaScript as your projects grow in scale and complexity. TypeScript also helps you catch bugs and errors faster by providing you and any other team members working on the project a nice structured way of writing code.
- Specifically, it is a `strictly typed language`, which means that it requires the programmer to be explicit about things like the types of data a variable can hold, or the types of data a function can return or accept as parameters.
- Additionally, it requires a `compiler` that allows programmers to discover errors when compiling vs. as run-time errors, which can make debugging significantly easier.
